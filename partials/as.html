<p>The <code>as</code> keyword is used to give a module a different name. Here is a quick example:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle as pen
pen.write("I'm really turtle!")
</code></pre>
<p>Every now and again this is useful if we already have a local variable or function that shares the name of a module that we want to use.</p>
