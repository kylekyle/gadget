<p><code>pass</code> is a null operation â€” when it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed, for example:

<pre><code>
def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)
</code></pre>
